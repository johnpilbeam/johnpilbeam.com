## Introduction

This year a lot of my focus has been on the working with colleagues across the Bodleian Libraries. This has included helping to establish a Community of Practice (CoP) for Staff IT Skills. We have developed a community on Teams and also held two onsite events at library venues. The first event looked at AI and the most recent focused on **Digital Tools for Managing Tasks**. Read on for summaries of my presentations at these events.

## How I am using AI

In my role as Web/Digital Officer at the Sainsbury Library, I leverage generative AI tools to streamline workflows and enhance content creation. Platforms like Buffer and Lumen5 assist with social media management and video generation, while Adobe Creative Cloud’s AI capabilities improve photo editing. I also use GitHub Copilot for coding tasks, simplifying processes like data analysis dashboards. Additionally, the University’s ChatGPT Enterprise initiative integrates AI into academic work, showcasing the potential of customized, secure AI applications.

## Task Management Techniques

Efficient task management is essential for productivity, and I explored four key methods: Getting Things Done (GTD), Kanban Boards, Time Blocking, and the Pomodoro Technique. GTD focuses on capturing and organizing tasks, while Kanban Boards visualize workflows with a “To Do, Doing, Done” approach. Time Blocking helps structure the day by assigning specific time slots for tasks, and the Pomodoro Technique alternates focused work intervals with short breaks to maintain energy and focus. These methods can be adapted to fit individual needs and workflows.
