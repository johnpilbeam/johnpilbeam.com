# Jekyll and GitHub Pages
This website was developed using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). So this seems like an appropriate first post. For more information about setting up your own website, read the excellent _[Building a static website with Jekyll and GitHub Pages](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages)_ by Amanda Visconti on The Programming Historian.
